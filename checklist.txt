1.Design Phase
Write out instruction set (ISA) with opcodes + operands
Document how instructions are encoded in binary (e.g., 1 byte opcode + 1–2 bytes operands)

2.Core Emulator
Create memory array in C++
Create struct/class for CPU (holds registers, flags, PC, SP)
Implement fetch–decode–execute loop
Implement data movement instructions (MOV, LOAD, STORE)
Implement arithmetic/logic instructions (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
Implement control flow (JMP, JZ, JNZ, HLT)

3.Assembler (Basic)
Write a parser that reads assembly text
Map mnemonics (MOV, ADD, etc.) to opcodes
Handle registers and immediate values
Output machine code (binary/bytecode file)
Test with a simple program (e.g., add two numbers)

4.Program Loader
Write a function to load binary file into emulator memory
Set PC = 0 at start
Run program via fetch–decode–execute

5.Stack Support
Implement PUSH and POP
Implement CALL (push PC, jump to function)
Implement RET (pop PC)
Test with recursive program (e.g., factorial)

6.Debugger Mode
Add step-by-step execution (--debug flag)
Print registers + memory state after each instruction
Add breakpoints (BREAK address)

7.I/O System
Implement IN Rn (read integer from stdin)
Implement OUT Rn (print integer to stdout)
Test with simple interactive program (e.g., calculator)

8.Assembler Enhancements
Add support for labels (instead of raw addresses)
Add support for comments
Add error messages for invalid instructions

9.Testing Programs
Write assembly program for Fibonacci sequence
Write assembly program for factorial
Write assembly program for summing an array
Write assembly program that uses branching + loops

10.Optional Stretch Features
Add GUI (registers + memory view)
Implement interrupts (keyboard handler)
Optimize with JIT instruction caching
Write a tiny “OS” in your assembly (basic scheduler, I/O)
